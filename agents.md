# AI Agent Instructions

This file explains how to interpret the documentation in `docs/Ai` so future assistants can pick up context quickly.

## Source of Truth
- Read `docs/Ai/PURPOSE.md` first to understand goals and user intent.
- Read `docs/Ai/ARCHITECTURE.md` next to understand structure and flow.
- Read `docs/Ai/CHANGELOG.md` to see recent changes and avoid rework.

## Working Rules
- Do not rename the `docs/Ai` folder.
- Keep documentation in sync with behavioral changes.
- Add a changelog entry for any player-facing or architectural change.
- When unsure, prefer simple, readable JavaScript over additional tooling.
