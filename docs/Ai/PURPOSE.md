# Purpose

## Project Goal
Build a fast, friendly math game where falling drops are cleared by typing answers. The game should feel responsive, reward improvement, and adapt difficulty in a fair way.

## Design Principles
- No friction: answers clear immediately without pressing Enter.
- Skill-based progression: performance drives speed and range, not arbitrary timers.
- Clarity over complexity: plain HTML/CSS/JS, minimal moving parts.
- Playable on first load: no build tools or installs required.

## Current Desires (User Intent)
- Drops fall from the sky and clear when the correct answer is typed.
- Startup choices include level, operations, and number range.
- Division range means quotient range.
- Progressive difficulty.
- Per-operation ratings: speed and accuracy are tracked independently.
- Overall rating is shown but not emphasized as "ELO".
