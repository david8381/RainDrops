# Purpose

## Project Goal
Build a fast, friendly math game where falling drops are cleared by typing answers. The game should feel responsive, reward improvement, and adapt difficulty in a fair way.

## Design Principles
- No friction: answers clear immediately without pressing Enter.
- Skill-based progression: performance drives speed and range, not arbitrary timers.
- Clarity over complexity: plain HTML/CSS/JS, minimal moving parts.
- Playable on first load: no build tools or installs required.

## Current Desires (User Intent)
- Drops fall from the sky and clear when the correct answer is typed.
- Startup choices include level and operations.
- Operations include add/subtract/multiply/divide plus factors-of-10 decimal shifting.
- Number range grows with progression (division range means quotient range).
- Progressive difficulty with per-operation levels and ranges.
- Per-operation ratings: drop rate and accuracy are tracked independently.
- Overall rating is shown but not emphasized as "ELO".
- Boss battles alternate between drop swarms and a ship with hull/wing/gun parts that use different difficulty ranges and can stun the player.
